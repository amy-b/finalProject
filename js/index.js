//Setup: Call random cards onto each card div (81 cards total with four different variables: color - red, green, purple; number - one, two three; shape - squiggle, oval, diamond; shade - striped, solid, blank)

            //Step 1: Retrieve the variables of the card one, two, and three: color, number, shade, shape

            //Step 2: Compare the variables of card one, two and three

            //if card one and two match with one variable, compare to card three. If card three matches on same variable tell user "correct"

            //else if card one, two, and three do not match on all variables tell user "correct"

            //else tell user "Incorrect"
