  <h1>Set Card Game</h1>
 <h2>Instructions</h2>
 <p>The object of the game is to identify a SET of 3 cards from 12 cards placed face up in from of you. Each card has four features, which can vary as follows:</p>
 <!--Images of four categories goes here: Shape, Color, Number, Shading-->
</p>A SET consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards' features, looked at one-by-one, are the same on each card, or, are different on each card. All of the features must seperately satisfy this rule. In other words: shape must be either the same on all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3 cards; color must be either the same on all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3, etc. Examples see below</p>
